        That must be so confusing for a little girl.
        And I know you're going to need me here with you.
        But I'm losing myself, and I'm afraid you're gonna lose me too.

        This magic keeps me alive, but it's making me crazy,
        And I need to save you, but who's going to save me?
        Please forgive me for whatever I do,
        When I don't remember you.

        Marceline, I can feel myself slipping away.
        I can't remember what it made me say.
        But I remember that I saw you frown.
        I swear it wasn't me, it was the crown.

        This magic keeps me
        Alive, but it's making me crazy.
        And I need to save you, but who's going to save me?
        Please forgive me for whatever I do,

        Please forgive me for whatever I do,
